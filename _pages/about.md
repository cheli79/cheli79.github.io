My name is Cheng Lin (林城). I earned my MS in Computational Social Science and my PhD in Analytical Sociology from Linköping University. In Feb. 2025, I defended my dissertation, [Navigating Stronger Evidence: Unobservable Processes and Causal Mechanisms in Social Trajectories](https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1926069&dswid=9708). A big thanks to my opponent (Jennie E. Brand) and the committee (Satu Helske, Lars Brännström, Anja Jørgensen, and Ben Wilson) for their time, insights, and valuable discussions. 

My dissertation explores the integration of statistical causal inference and mechanism-based explanations in analytical sociology, addressing the challenge of unobservable processes in robust causal explanations. While analytical sociology emphasizes mechanisms, it often struggles to align with statistical inference. By combining the structural causal model (SCM) and the potential outcomes approach (PO), this work bridges gaps in handling unmeasured confounders and alternative mechanisms. It advances theory-driven causal inference through evidential pluralism and triangulation, strengthening the validity of causal claims.

Empirically, using Swedish register data, the dissertation examines neighborhood effects on social assistance dependency, the protective role of homeownership against unemployment, and the impact of unmeasured confounders in sociological research.

Research Interests
------
Building on these findings, future research will focus on multidimensional poverty and inequality, expanding beyond economic measures to consider spatial and institutional dimensions. Interest in space and health is reinforced by the role of housing in economic stability and well-being. With plans to incorporate satellite imagery for analyzing neighborhood effects and spatial inequalities. Methodological challenges in causal inference drive further exploration in epistemology, methodology, and computational social science, while engagement with the Science of Science will examine knowledge production processes and their implications for social research.
